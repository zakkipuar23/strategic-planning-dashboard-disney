#Strategic Planning Dashboard for Disney
##This is my submission for Onyx Data Visualization challenge. Raw data could be downloaded also from this repository. My personal analysis is described here. There are three strategic objectives I'm trying to influenced with this simple visualization :
### 1. Analyze which genre is the most profitable for Disney and do they focus on that genre. We could answer this comprehensively by looking at the first three look-alike chart.

At the left one, the chart is showing Productivity : how many total movie is produced.
Middle one is showing total inflation adjusted gross profit,
and the right one is about profitability rate (gross profit divided by total produced movie). These are three metrics that should be analyzed sequentially.

For instance, Disney produce Comedy movie the most, while adventure genre contributed gross profit the most. But overall, musical is the genre with the highest profitability rate, with only produce 16 movies but can generate third highest gross profit.



### 2. Is it right that Disney should make more musical movie? Maybe not if we look at line chart on the left bottom part. Profitability rate of disney musical movie is getting lower and lower every year (if you're confused how to define if it decrease or increase, please see the dashed trendline)

I guess we can safely assume that musical movie is already passed their golden era. But it should be validated with external data like demand data or questionnaire result from people around the world.



### 3. Identifying when is the right time to release movie in order to get highest gross profit? From the last line chart on the right bottom side, we can know that June, November and December are the only three months that exceed the average gross profit.

It will be better if these dataset is completed with country, since there's likely different trend at each country. So Disney have enough consideration to release movie at the right time and the right place.
